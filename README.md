# LI-FI
Li-Fi or Light fidelity is a wireless Communication Technology that uses the  light to transmit data and information among different devices. Li-Fi can send  the data at a very high speed, Theoretically up to 100 Gbit/sec, over the normal  visible light, Infrared, or Ultraviolet spectrum

*Project Description*:

1- The sender platform (TM4C123GH6PM) is connected to three sensors 
(Fume Sensor, Ultrasonic Sensor, And Magnetic Sensor).

2- If sensors detect any danger (ex: fire, Door is opened, or intrusion). Data 
will be sent over

2.1 The light to the receiver platform, which can be any other board,
to turn on alarms represented in a flashing Lamp, buzzer, and a 
LCD that displays a sentence related to the detected event (ex: 
“Fire is reported”).

2.2 Bluetooth to a mobile phone (app inventor is an easy option)
with the same sentence as the LCD.

3- The system has 2 pushbuttons for the start/stop operations. it can be 
closed at any time.

4- If any alarm fires, the sounds continue until a mute pushbutton is 
pressed.

5- When the mute pushbutton is pressed, all alarms will be turned off after 
5 seconds, but the system is still powered on.
